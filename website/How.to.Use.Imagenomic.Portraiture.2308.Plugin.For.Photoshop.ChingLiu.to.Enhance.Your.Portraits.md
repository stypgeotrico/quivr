In this article, we will show you how to use Imagenomic Portraiture 2.3.08 Plugin For Photoshop [ChingLiu] to enhance your portraits in a few simple steps. You will need Adobe Photoshop CS6 or later, and the plugin installed on your computer. You can download the plugin from [Imagenomic's website](https://www.imagenomic.com/Products/Portraiture) or from [SolidTorrents](https://solidtorrents.to/torrents/imagenomic-portraiture-2-3-08-plugin-for-photoshop-e5dca/60b404f7f14c9dae8226187b/). The plugin comes with a license key that you need to activate it.
  
## Step 1: Open Your Portrait Image in Photoshop
  
Launch Photoshop and open the portrait image that you want to edit. You can use any image format that Photoshop supports, such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc. Make sure that the image has a good resolution and lighting, as this will affect the quality of the plugin's results.
  
## Step 2: Duplicate the Background Layer
  
Before applying the plugin, it is recommended that you duplicate the background layer of your image, so that you can compare the before and after effects and make adjustments if needed. To do this, go to `Layer > Duplicate Layer` or press `Ctrl+J` on your keyboard. Rename the new layer as "Portraiture" or something similar.
  
## Step 3: Apply Imagenomic Portraiture Plugin
  
Select the "Portraiture" layer and go to `Filter > Imagenomic > Portraiture...`. This will open the plugin's interface, where you can see a preview of your image with the default settings applied. You can zoom in and out, pan, and toggle between before and after views using the buttons at the bottom of the window.
  
The plugin has three main tabs: **Skin Mask**, **Smoothing**, and **Enhancements**. The first tab allows you to adjust the mask that defines the skin areas that will be affected by the plugin. You can use the eyedropper tools to select or deselect skin tones, or use the sliders to fine-tune the hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast of the mask. You can also invert or feather the mask if needed.
  
The second tab allows you to adjust the smoothing parameters of the plugin. You can use the presets on the left side of the window to choose a predefined level of smoothing, from "Normal" to "High". You can also customize the settings by using the sliders on the right side of the window. The sliders control the amount of detail, sharpness, warmth, and contrast that will be applied to the skin.
  
The third tab allows you to adjust the enhancements parameters of the plugin. You can use these settings to add some finishing touches to your portrait, such as improving the skin tone, reducing redness, adding glow, or whitening teeth. You can also use these settings to create different effects and styles for your portrait, such as sepia, black and white, vintage, etc.
  
## Step 4: Save Your Edited Image
  
Once you are happy with your settings, click on "OK" to apply them to your image. You will see that your "Portraiture" layer has been updated with the plugin's effects. You can now compare it with your original background layer by toggling its visibility on and off using the eye icon on the
